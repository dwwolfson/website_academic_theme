I'm a wildlife ecologist currently in a PhD program at the University of Minnesota. My research interests include investigating the drivers of animal movement and applying the knowledge of dynamic animal space use to inform wildlife management and conservation. My grad research looks at multiple aspects of trumpeter swan movement ecology, genetics, and ecotoxicology. For more information on the project go to: https://trumpeterswan.netlify.app/.
