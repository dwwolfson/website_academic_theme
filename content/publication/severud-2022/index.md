abstract: Age-structured population models require reliable estimates of cohort-specific
  survival rates, yet vital rates of younger age classes are often difficult to estimate
  because of the logistical challenges of monitoring young animals. As part of a study
  of sandhill cranes Antigone canadensis in the zone of contact between breeding distributions
  of the Eastern Population and Mid-continent Population in Minnesota, United States,
  we monitored first summer survival of 34 sandhill cranes (hereafter, ``colts'')
  using VHF and/or GPS-GSM transmitters. We estimated daily survival probabilities
  from 19 to 120 days post-hatch using a generalized linear model accounting for interval
  censoring, resulting in an estimated period survival rate of 0.52 (90% confidence
  interval 0.36– 0.71) over summer (100 days). Estimated daily probabilities of survival
  increased as colts became older and fledged (at 70– 75 days post-hatch), when they
  presumably became less vulnerable to predation. Causes of mortality were mostly
  unknown aside from one case of a collision with a vehicle. There is a scarcity of
  published colt survival rate estimates for sandhill cranes and what is available
  varies widely by study site. Region-specific sandhill crane colt survival rate estimates
  can inform future management efforts and inform population dynamics research and
  overall natural history knowledge of sandhill cranes.
