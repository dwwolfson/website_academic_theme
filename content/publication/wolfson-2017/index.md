abstract: Sandhill cranes (Antigone canadensis) are long-lived birds with relatively
  low recruitment rates, making accurate knowledge of abundance and distribution critical
  for well-informed harvest management. Minnesota, USA, is one of few states containing
  portions of 2 distinct breeding populations of greater sandhill cranes (A. c. tabida)—the
  Mid-continent Population (MCP) and Eastern Population (EP). Historically, the breeding
  range of MCP cranes in Minnesota was restricted to the extreme northwestern portion
  of the state, whereas the breeding range of EP cranes was limited to the east–central
  part of the state with a large area of separation between the 2 populations. Whereas
  MCP cranes have exhibited stable population estimates over time, EP cranes are currently
  experiencing a significant increase in population size and a concurrent expansion
  of breeding range. Our objectives were to evaluate the current range boundaries
  of the 2 populations in Minnesota and determine whether the populations overlap
  on their breeding areas and autumn staging grounds. We captured and attached Global
  Positioning System–Global System for Mobile Communications transmitters to 50 cranes
  in the zone between the historical breeding-range boundaries of the 2 populations.
  Movements of cranes revealed that EP cranes have greatly expanded their breeding
  range in Minnesota while MCP cranes have experienced more moderate range expansion
  in the state. Results of this study provide the first documentation of overlap between
  the breeding ranges of EP and MCP sandhill cranes. Our results also suggest that
  staging areas in northwestern Minnesota, where recreational harvest targeted at
  MCP cranes was allowed beginning in 2010, are being used by both populations and
  there is overlap in migration corridors, as evidenced by 4 cranes that used both
  the Mississippi and Central Flyways. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.
