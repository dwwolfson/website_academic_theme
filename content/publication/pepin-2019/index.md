abstract: Success of large-scale control programs for established invasive species
  is challenging to evaluate because of spatial variability in expansion rates, management
  techniques, and the strength of management intensity. For a well-established invasive
  species in the spreading phase of invasion, a useful metric of impact is the magnitude
  by which control slows the rate of spatial spread. The prevention of spatial spreading
  likely results in substantial benefits in terms of ecosystem or economic damage
  that is prevented by an expanding invasive species. To understand how local management
  actions could impact the spatial spread of an established invasive species, we analyzed
  distribution and management data for feral swine across contiguous United States
  using occupancy analysis. We quantified changes in the rate of spatial expansion
  of feral swine and its relationship to local management actions. We found that after
  4 yr of enhanced control, invasion probability decreased by 8% on average relative
  to pre-program rates. This decrease was as high as 15% on average in states with
  low-density populations of feral swine. The amount of decrease in invasion rate
  was attributed to removal intensity in neighboring counties and depended on the
  extent of neighboring counties with feral swine (spatial heterogeneity in local
  invasion pressure). Although we did not find a significant overall increase in the
  probability of elimination, increased elimination probability tended to occur in
  regions with low invasion pressure. Accounting for spatial heterogeneity in invasion
  pressure was important for quantifying management impacts (i.e., the relationship
  between management intensity and spatial spreading processes) because management
  impacts changed depending on the strength of invasion pressure from neighboring
  counties. Predicting reduction in spatial spread of an invasive species is an important
  first step in valuation of overall damage reduction for invasive species control
  programs by providing estimates of where a species may be, and thus which natural
  and agricultural resources would be affected, if the control program had not been
  operating. For minimizing losses from spatial expansion of an invasive species,
  our framework can be used for adaptive resource prioritization to areas where spatial
  expansion and underlying damage potential are concurrently highest.
