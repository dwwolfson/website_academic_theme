abstract: 'Sandhill Cranes Antigone canadensis exhibit delayed sexual maturity and
  breeding, and therefore juvenile Cranes searching for suitable territories to occupy
  have different ecological constraints on movements than adults, which must defend
  a territory and raise young. We used fine-scale GPS telemetry data to characterize
  and compare movements of adult and juvenile Cranes near the boundary between two
  populations in Minnesota, USA, from arrival on natal areas in the spring until staging
  prior to autumn migration. Juvenile and adult Cranes had marked differences in movement
  patterns throughout the breeding season. Juveniles were more likely than adults
  to display long-distance movements: they revisited areas less frequently throughout
  the breeding season and they had lower average residence times.'
