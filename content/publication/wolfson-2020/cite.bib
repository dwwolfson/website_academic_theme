 abstract = {Sandhill Cranes Antigone canadensis exhibit delayed sexual maturity and breeding, and therefore juvenile Cranes searching for suitable territories to occupy have different ecological constraints on movements than adults, which must defend a territory and raise young. We used fine-scale GPS telemetry data to characterize and compare movements of adult and juvenile Cranes near the boundary between two populations in Minnesota, USA, from arrival on natal areas in the spring until staging prior to autumn migration. Juvenile and adult Cranes had marked differences in movement patterns throughout the breeding season. Juveniles were more likely than adults to display long-distance movements: they revisited areas less frequently throughout the breeding season and they had lower average residence times.},
