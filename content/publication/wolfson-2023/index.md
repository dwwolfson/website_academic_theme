abstract: Invasion of nonindigenous species is considered one of the most urgent problems
  affecting native ecosystems and agricultural systems. Mechanistic models that account
  for short-term population dynamics can improve prediction because they incorporate
  differing demographic processes that link the environmental conditions of a spatial
  location explicitly with the invasion process. Yet short-term population dynamics
  are rarely accounted for in spatial models of invasive species spread.
