  abstract = {Success of large-scale control programs for established invasive species is challenging to evaluate because of spatial variability in expansion rates, management techniques, and the strength of management intensity. For a well-established invasive species in the spreading phase of invasion, a useful metric of impact is the magnitude by which control slows the rate of spatial spread. The prevention of spatial spreading likely results in substantial benefits in terms of ecosystem or economic damage that is prevented by an expanding invasive species. To understand how local management actions could impact the spatial spread of an established invasive species, we analyzed distribution and management data for feral swine across contiguous United States using occupancy analysis. We quantified changes in the rate of spatial expansion of feral swine and its relationship to local management actions. We found that after 4 yr of enhanced control, invasion probability decreased by 8\% on average relative to pre-program rates. This decrease was as high as 15\% on average in states with low-density populations of feral swine. The amount of decrease in invasion rate was attributed to removal intensity in neighboring counties and depended on the extent of neighboring counties with feral swine (spatial heterogeneity in local invasion pressure). Although we did not find a significant overall increase in the probability of elimination, increased elimination probability tended to occur in regions with low invasion pressure. Accounting for spatial heterogeneity in invasion pressure was important for quantifying management impacts (i.e., the relationship between management intensity and spatial spreading processes) because management impacts changed depending on the strength of invasion pressure from neighboring counties. Predicting reduction in spatial spread of an invasive species is an important first step in valuation of overall damage reduction for invasive species control programs by providing estimates of where a species may be, and thus which natural and agricultural resources would be affected, if the control program had not been operating. For minimizing losses from spatial expansion of an invasive species, our framework can be used for adaptive resource prioritization to areas where spatial expansion and underlying damage potential are concurrently highest.},

  abstract = {Age-structured population models require reliable estimates of cohort-specific survival rates, yet vital rates of younger age classes are often difficult to estimate because of the logistical challenges of monitoring young animals. As part of a study of sandhill cranes Antigone canadensis in the zone of contact between breeding distributions of the Eastern Population and Mid-continent Population in Minnesota, United States, we monitored first summer survival of 34 sandhill cranes (hereafter, ``colts'') using VHF and/or GPS-GSM transmitters. We estimated daily survival probabilities from 19 to 120 days post-hatch using a generalized linear model accounting for interval censoring, resulting in an estimated period survival rate of 0.52 (90\% confidence interval 0.36\textendash 0.71) over summer (100 days). Estimated daily probabilities of survival increased as colts became older and fledged (at 70\textendash 75 days post-hatch), when they presumably became less vulnerable to predation. Causes of mortality were mostly unknown aside from one case of a collision with a vehicle. There is a scarcity of published colt survival rate estimates for sandhill cranes and what is available varies widely by study site. Region-specific sandhill crane colt survival rate estimates can inform future management efforts and inform population dynamics research and overall natural history knowledge of sandhill cranes.},

  abstract = {Motion-activated cameras (``camera traps'') are increasingly used in ecological and management studies for remotely observing wildlife and are amongst the most powerful tools for wildlife research. However, studies involving camera traps result in millions of images that need to be analysed, typically by visually observing each image, in order to extract data that can be used in ecological analyses. We trained machine learning models using convolutional neural networks with the ResNet-18 architecture and 3,367,383 images to automatically classify wildlife species from camera trap images obtained from five states across the United States. We tested our model on an independent subset of images not seen during training from the United States and on an out-of-sample (or ``out-of-distribution'' in the machine learning literature) dataset of ungulate images from Canada. We also tested the ability of our model to distinguish empty images from those with animals in another out-of-sample dataset from Tanzania, containing a faunal community that was novel to the model. The trained model classified approximately 2,000 images per minute on a laptop computer with 16 gigabytes of RAM. The trained model achieved 98\% accuracy at identifying species in the United States, the highest accuracy of such a model to date. Out-of-sample validation from Canada achieved 82\% accuracy and correctly identified 94\% of images containing an animal in the dataset from Tanzania. We provide an r package (Machine Learning for Wildlife Image Classification) that allows the users to (a) use the trained model presented here and (b) train their own model using classified images of wildlife from their studies. The use of machine learning to rapidly and accurately classify wildlife in camera trap images can facilitate non-invasive sampling designs in ecological studies by reducing the burden of manually analysing images. Our r package makes these methods accessible to ecologists.},

Minnesota, USA, is one of few states containing portions of 2 distinct breeding populations of greater sandhill cranes (A. c. tabida)\textemdash the Mid-continent Population (MCP) and Eastern Population (EP). Historically, the breeding range of MCP cranes in Minnesota was restricted to the extreme northwestern portion of the state, whereas the breeding range of EP cranes was limited to the east\textendash central part of the state with a large area of separation between the 2 populations. Whereas MCP cranes have exhibited stable population estimates over time, EP cranes are currently experiencing a significant increase in population size and a concurrent expansion of breeding range.

We captured and attached Global Positioning System\textendash Global System for Mobile Communications transmitters to 50 cranes in the zone between the historical breeding-range boundaries of the 2 populations. Movements of cranes revealed that EP cranes have greatly expanded their breeding range in Minnesota while MCP cranes have experienced more moderate range expansion in the state. Results of this study provide the first documentation of overlap between the breeding ranges of EP and MCP sandhill cranes. Our results also suggest that staging areas in northwestern Minnesota, where recreational harvest targeted at MCP cranes was allowed beginning in 2010, are being used by both populations and there is overlap in migration corridors, as evidenced by 4 cranes that used both the Mississippi and Central Flyways. \textcopyright{} 2017 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {Sandhill cranes (Antigone canadensis) are long-lived birds with relatively low recruitment rates, making accurate knowledge of abundance and distribution critical for well-informed harvest management. Minnesota is one of few states containing portions of 2 different breeding populations of greater sandhill cranes (A. c. tabida)\textemdash the Mid-continent Population (MCP), which has a harvest season in northwestern Minnesota in the fall, and Eastern Population (EP), which is not currently harvested in the state. Although the historical range boundaries of these populations have not been in close proximity during the 20th century, EP cranes are currently experiencing a significant increase in population size and a concurrent expansion of breeding range. A better understanding of range boundaries and information regarding fine-scale space use of cranes (both adults and juveniles) at different times of the year, is necessary to inform  harvest management (e.g., determination of appropriate hunting zone boundaries and timing of harvest season).  Our objectives were to 1) evaluate the current range boundaries of the 2 populations in Minnesota and whether the populations overlap on their breeding areas and autumn staging grounds; and 2) characterize the fine-scale movements and behavior of cranes after their arrival on breeding grounds in the spring until fall staging. We captured and attached Global Positioning System\textendash Global System for Mobile Communications transmitters to 50 cranes in the zone between the historical breeding-range boundaries of the 2 populations.  We were able to document, for the first time, overlap between the breeding ranges of EP and MCP sandhill cranes. EP and MCP cranes also both used some of the same staging areas in northwestern Minnesota, where recreational harvest targeted at MCP cranes began in 2010.  Moreover, we observed multiple cranes using both Mississippi and Central flyways when migrating between breeding and wintering grounds; choice of flyway has historically been used to assign population affiliation (Mississippi Flyway = EP, Central Flyway = MCP). Juvenile and adult cranes exhibited different movement strategies during the spring and summer. Juveniles traversed larger areas and were more likely to display long-distance roaming behavior, whereas adults were more likely to revisit the same areas. We hypothesize that these differences may reflect constraints adults experience when nesting and brood rearing, and differential knowledge of the landscape between adult and juvenile birds.},
